    <h2 class="blue">Bio</h2>
    <p class="creative">Anthony Santos (born July 21, 1981),[1] known professionally as Romeo Santos, is an American[2] singer, songwriter, actor, record producer and former lead singer of the American bachata group Aventura. After releasing several albums with Aventura, the group went its separate ways. Since then, Romeo has embarked on a solo career which in three years has spawned seven number one songs on the Hot Latin Songs chart and eight number ones on the Tropical Songs chart.</p>
    <p class="creative">Santos was born on July 21, 1981, in The Bronx, New York City, to a Dominican father and a Puerto Rican mother.[3] He had a humble upbringing, with his father working construction and his mother staying at home to take care of the family. Before the success of Aventura, Santos founded a group called “Los Tinellers” ("The Teenagers" written phonetically in a Dominican pronunciation), with his cousin Henry and two friends in the early 1990s. The group released an album called Trampa De Amor, and by the end of the decade, they changed the name of the band to Aventura.</p>
